    "description": "Regardless of where itâ€™s from, falafel is a simple street food, a Middle Eastern fast food if you will. Yet, for something served up on pretty much every street corner, it can seem exceedingly difficult and daunting to get right at home. Not anymore! This air-fried falafel is so easy to make, packed with flavor and crispy even without deep-frying.",
